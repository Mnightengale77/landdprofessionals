<p class="jos"> Virginia Williams

Year Up Student In Chicago

I was born and raised on the south side of Chicago. Despite of the neighborhood I come from, I am a highly motivated, dedicated and determined individual. I will not let anything obstruct me from accomplishing my goals. I am currently a student at Year Up Chicago. A Non-profit Organization that works with young adults ages 18-24 who’s willing to take an advantage of a life changing opportunity. Year Up courses incorporates Business Communication and Technology. I am more focused on Software and working with Microsoft Office and Applications.

After graduation I plan to attend college and obtain my Bachelor’s degree in Business Communication and an Associate’s degree in Technology. I am the first person in my immediate family to attend college and earn a certificate/degree. I am an innovative thinker, I am good at improvising and being creative. With my knowledge, constant training and hunger for success I am confident that I will accomplish every goal I have set for myself.

Throughout my life, I have always been told that I have potential, but it was not until I was 18 years of age when I decided to do something with it. At the age of 18 I began to become more cautious about the decisions I made. I would take the time to think about the outcome my actions would have. I even started planning my life goals and the deadlines by which I wanted to reach them. At 18 I had my first job as a Cashier and Box Office Assistant at Harper Theater in Hyde Park, a little after a year I started applying for colleges and programs that was equivalent, such as Year Up. When I got accepted to both Year Up and Malcolm X College at the same time, I felt so full of joy. I decided to attend Year Up first and after I graduate the program I would go to Malcolm X. I choose to attend Year Up first because I thought it would better prepare me for college and the cooperate world, which is has. I am so eager to graduate the program and start my career as a young tech woman. I am ready for what the world has to offer</p>
